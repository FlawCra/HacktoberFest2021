# HacktoberFest2021

This repository will automatically assign the `hacktoberfest` and `hacktoberfest-accepted` labels to all submitted pull requests.

**Please do not abuse this system as you will be disqualified anyway.**

This repository is meant to simplify the process of assigning the labels as many other repos have take a lot of time to do this.

We hope you submit some kind of useful code to this repository.

The format for submitting code is:
`Your programming language name`/`function name.extension`
(If the folder doesn't exist yet, please go ahead an create it)
